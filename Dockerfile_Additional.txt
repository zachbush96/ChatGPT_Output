This Dockerfile uses the ubuntu:20.04 base image, installs the openssh-server package, sets up SSH logging, enables root login, and sets up a logging script that logs login information, commands, and files that are downloaded.
You can build the Docker image using the docker build command:
$ docker build -t ssh-server-logger .
Once the image is built, you can run it using the docker run command:
$ docker run -d -p 2222:22 ssh-server-logger
This will run the Docker image in detached mode, mapping port 2222 on the host to port 22 in the container. You can then connect to the SSH server using a SSH client, such as ssh:
$ ssh root@localhost -p 2222
You can view the log files using the docker exec command:
$ docker exec -it <container-id> cat /var/log/ssh/ssh_login.log
$ docker exec -it <container-id> cat /var/log/ssh/ssh_commands.log
$ docker exec -it <container-id> cat /var/log/ssh/ssh_file_downloads.log
Replace <container-id> with the ID of the running Docker container.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.


{ME}
Can you give me an example of what each of those logs would look like?



Sure, here are some examples of what the log files might look like:
ssh_login.log:
[2022-12-06 14:32:25] root logged in from 10.0.2.2
[2022-12-06 14:35:34] user1 logged in from 10.0.2.3
[2022-12-06 14:40:01] user2 logged in from 10.0.2.4

ssh_commands.log:
[2022-12-06 14:33:01] root ran the "ls" command
[2022-12-06 14:33:10] root ran the "pwd" command
[2022-12-06 14:33:15] root ran the "whoami" command
[2022-12-06 14:34:01] user1 ran the "df" command
[2022-12-06 14:34:05] user1 ran the "uname -a" command

ssh_file_downloads.log:
[2022-12-06 14:36:12] user1 tried to download file "file.txt"
[2022-12-06 14:36:17] user1 successfully downloaded file "file.txt"
[2022-12-06 14:37:01] user2 tried to download file "another_file.txt"
[2022-12-06 14:37:05] user2 failed to download file "another_file.txt" (permission denied)
These are just examples, and the actual log files will depend on the specific actions taken by users when connected to the SSH server. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
